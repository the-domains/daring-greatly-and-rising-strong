  http://www.ted.com Brene Brown studies human connection -- our ability to
  empathize, belong, love. In a poignant, funny talk at TEDxHouston, she shares
  a deep insight from her research, one that sent her on a personal quest to
  know herself as well as to understand humanity. A talk to share.
